## IRS-published state aggregates fall short of what we need

We want to develop state weights for the TMD national microdata file that reflect *potential* SALT deductions in individual states, including itemizers and non-itemizers, before caps. We need state targets that correspond to this concept. The TMD microdata already conform to this concept.

IRS publishes state-by-state *actual* SALT deductions, not *potential* deductions. Actual SALT deductions in 2018+ are sharply reduced from pre-TCJA years due to the drop in itemization caused by the TCJA standard deduction increase. The IRS state data as reported are not suitable for targets. (The IRS reports actual deductions before the TCJA SALT cap so the cap does not cause problems in developing state targets.)

Note that this issue also arises for Congressional districts, where we take the same approach as described below.

## Our methodology in brief

We calculate each state's share of national IRS-reported *actual* SALT deductions. Next, we calculate SALT targets for each state by multiplying total *potential* SALT deductions in the TMD microdata file by these shares. We do this for each SALT variable, for each of the 10 AGI ranges for which the IRS reports *actual* state SALT deductions plus the total.

We use these estimates of potential SALT deductions as targets in the optimization routine that develops state weights.

The remainder of this page gives details on the relevant data and explains how we check the plausibility of our implicit assumption that potential SALT deductions are distributed across states in the same way as actual SALT deductions. We work with data for 2021, the latest year for which the IRS has reported aggregates by state and the year of our base TMD file.

## *Potential* SALT deductions in the national TMD microdata

The national TMD microdata include two uncapped SALT variables (links are to Tax-Calculator documentation):

-   [e18400](https://taxcalc.pslmodels.org/guide/input_vars.html#e18400): Itemizable state and local income/sales taxes, and

-   [e18500](https://taxcalc.pslmodels.org/guide/input_vars.html#e18500): Itemizable real-estate taxes paid

The TMD data also include capped variants of these variables.

These variables are actual or estimated amounts available to be deducted in the 2015 PUF base year, grown to 2021 at a rate intended to capture growth in state and local taxes. Thus, they are unaffected by the TCJA SALT cap or the fact that many 2015 itemizers will be non-itemizers in 2021 due to the TCJA standard deduction increase.

Thus, `e18400` and `e18500` in the TMD microdata represent *potential* SALT deductions for a large group of TCJA-era potential itemizers and are a good starting point for subnational data files.

The table below, calculated from the national TMD microdata, shows numbers and amounts of these variables in 2021 for filers and non filers, for itemization status under 2021 law and its high standard deduction. The filer itemizer rows correspond to what the IRS would report and are consistent with the concept of actual SALT deductions. The filer non-itemizer rows correspond to non-itemizers in 2021 who have available potential SALT deductions. We want to be sure to capture these potential deductions in our state targets and resulting state weights.

## *Actual* SALT deductions in the IRS-published state data

The IRS publishes actual SALT-related amounts in SOI Historical Table 2. The numbers and amounts for key variables, and their location on Schedule A (in parentheses) are:

-   **n18425, a18425**: State and local income taxes (line 5a)
-   **n18450, a18450**: State and local general sales tax (line 5a)
-   **n18500, a18500**: Real estate taxes (line 5b)
-   **n18800, a18800**: Personal property taxes (line 5c)
-   **n18460, a18460**: Limited state and local taxes (line 5e)
-   **n18300, a18300**: Taxes paid (line 7)

The screenshot below shows where these variables appear on 2021 Schedule A:

![](images/clipboard-565930362.png)

Note that the published summaries break out state and local income or sales taxes into the income and sales components but the TMD data only have the combined amount (`e18400`). In our work we have combined the two SOI amounts, which are mutually exclusive for any given taxpayer.

The table below, based upon IRS-published data from SOI Historical Table 2 (U.S. totals from state-level data), shows *actual* numbers and amounts for SALT-related variables in 2021 for those who itemized in 2021. The first two rows correspond, conceptually, to the first two rows in the table from the TMD (filers itemizing under 2021 law). The actual amounts are reasonably close to their corresponding TMD amounts (e.g., \$260.7 billion in actual State and local income or sales taxes vs. \$272.7 billion in the TMD data).

Other rows show details available in the SOI data.

Unfortunately, the published SOI Historical Table 2 data do not capture potential deductions for non-itemizers, which according to the TMD data are even larger than the actual deductions.

## Our methodology for capturing full state-level potential SALT deductions

We assume that potential SALT deductions for `e18400` and `e18500` are distributed across states in the same way that the published *actual* state SALT deductions are distributed: for example, if a state has 7% of the nation's *actual* real estate tax deductions for 2021 itemizers, it will have 7% of the aggregate amount of *potential* real estate deductions in our 2021 TMD file (`e18500`). We do this by AGI range.

This seems like a reasonable first-cut assumption given that we don't have direct data on potential SALT deductions of non-itemizers in 2021.

## How plausible is the assumption?

Just to get a grounding, we start by examining IRS-published SALT data over time, in aggregate and by AGI range, to get a sense of how things changed when the TCJA went into effect.

### IRS-published U.S. amounts over time

The table below shows how SALT amounts have changed over time. We can see the large post-2017 fall in the dollar amount of deductions and the even larger fall in the number of deductions. It makes sense that the average deduction would increase, given that remaining itemizers generally will have higher incomes and deductions than in the pre-TCJA era.

```{r}
#| label: salt-amounts-over-time

basesort <- c("18400", "18500", "18425", "18450", "18800", "18460", "18300")

soilong |> 
  filter(basevname %in% basesort, stabbr=="US", agistub==0) |> 
  select(stabbr, basevname, vname, vtype, year, value, udescription) |> 
  pivot_wider(names_from = year) |> 
  mutate(basevname=factor(basevname, levels=basesort)) |> 
  mutate(udescription=udescription[vtype=="amount"],
         .by=basevname) |> 
  arrange(vtype, basevname) |> 
  select(-vname) |> 
  gt() |> 
  tab_header(title=html("Actual SALT variables for the U.S. over time<br>Amounts in $ billions, counts in millions"),
             subtitle = "Source: IRS SOI Historical Table 2") |> 
  fmt_currency(columns = -c(stabbr, basevname, vtype, udescription), 
               rows = vtype=="amount",
               scale=1e-9, decimals=2) |> 
  fmt_number(columns = -c(stabbr, basevname, vtype, udescription), 
               rows = vtype=="count",
               scale=1e-6, decimals=2) |> 
  sub_missing(columns=everything(),
              missing_text="--")

```

### IRS-published U.S. amounts by AGI range over time

The next table shows a18400, State and local income or sales taxes (estimated), by AGI range over time. It is clear (with mental arithmetic) that the largest post-2017 percentage drops were in the lowest income ranges and the largest dollar drops were in the highest income ranges. This makes sense - the standard deduction increase would drive most lower and middle income taxpayers to the standard, but they would not have that much to lose, in dollar terms.

Note that in the IRS SOI data, there are no deductions at all on returns with AGI less than $1. This may be an artifact of the sample they use to estimate their published amounts, or it could be truth. In any event, it means that we will not have an easy way to develop targets for this income range, and we won't try to do so.


```{r}
#| label: income-sales-tax-by-agirange-amounts-over-time

soilong |> 
  filter(vname=="a18400", stabbr=="US") |> 
  select(year, agistub, agilabel, value) |> 
  pivot_wider(names_from = year) |> 
  gt() |> 
  tab_header(title=html("Actual a18400 amounts: State and local income or sales taxes (estimated)<br>Amounts for the U.S. in $ billions"),
             subtitle = "Source: IRS SOI Historical Table 2") |> 
  fmt_currency(columns = -c(agistub, agilabel), scale=1e-9, decimals=1) |> 
  sub_missing(columns=everything(),
              missing_text="--")

```

## How closely do current SALT data correspond to pre-TCJA SALT data, using IRS-published data for both?

Next, because we assume in our target-setting that post-TCJA state shares of the U.S. for actual SALT deductions will be reasonably good predictors of unknown state shares of potential SALT deductions, we examine how these shares changed between 2017 and 2018. Because 2017 (pre-TCJA) was reasonably similar, conceptually, to potential deductions, we hope it is highly correlated with actual deductions in 2018. We also look at the correlation between 2018 and 2021, in the hope that the correlation continues.

We do this both statistically (correlation coefficients) and graphically.

```{r}
#| label: salt-shares-data
#| eval: true

salt <- soilong |> 
  filter(year %in% c(2017, 2018, 2021),
         basevname %in% c("18400", "18500"),
         !stabbr %in% c("US", "OA", "PR")) |> 
  mutate(agistubf=factor(agistub, levels=agilabels$agistub, labels=agilabels$agilabel)) |> 
  select(stabbr, year, basevname, vtype, udescription, agistub, agistubf, value) |> 
  pivot_wider(names_from = year, names_prefix = "y")

saltshares <- salt |> 
  mutate(across(starts_with("y"),
                \(x) x / sum(x)),
                .by=c(agistub, basevname, vtype))

```

### Correlation coefficients

The next 2 tables show correlation coefficients:

-   between 2017, which we think of as the last year for which we have data on "potential" deductions, and 2018, which we think of as the first year for which we only have actual deductions; and
-   between 2018 and 2021, the most recent year of data on actual deductions.

The first table shows the minimum and maximum correlations across income ranges for a particular variable for a pair of years. The second table shows all of the correlations (correlations within each income range).

We would like these correlations to be high, giving us comfort that the state shares of actual deductions are highly related to state shares of potential deductions. As the tables show, the correlations are quite high.

### Plots of state shares

Finally, we plot the 2021 shares of the nation for our two main SALT variables, (1) 18400 State and local income or sales taxes (estimated) and (2) a18500 Real estate taxes, for the pre-TCJA year of 2017 and immediate TCJA year of 2018, by AGI range. We also plot the 45-degree line. We put 2018 on the x-axis because we think of it as the share of national "actual" SALT deduction, which we use to predict the share of national "predicted" SALT deduction (the 2017 share).

For most states, 2018 seems like a good predictor of

## Conclusions

Based on the relationships shown above, the assumption that potential SALT deductions are distributed across states in the same way that actual SALT deductions are distributed across states seems like a good simple assumption.

It is easy to think of reasons why this might not always be true. 

For example, suppose there are two states of equal size, A and B. A has relatively many high income taxpayers and B has relatively few. Suppose that all taxpayers in each state claim itemized deductions. Suppose that A, as a richer state, has higher taxes than B. Finally, suppose that A starts out with 60% of the nation's SALT deduction because of its higher taxes, even though everyone itemizes in both states, and B starts out with 40%. Suppose now that the standard deduction is increased significantly.  Suppose this happens within a year, so that we don't have to worry about confounding from other factors such as changes in the level of state and local taxation, or changes in income. In this scenario, assume that all of B's relatively lower-income taxpayers will claim the standard deduction while only half of A's taxpayers claim the standard deduction because, with higher incomes and higher taxes, they have more itemized deductions. In this case, even though A has far fewer itemizers than before, it will have 100% of the actual SALT deduction.

In this example, assuming that a state's share of potential deductions predicts its share of actual deductions would be quite wrong. If we only observed A's actual deductions, we'd predict that it has 100% of potential deductions, but in fact it only has 60% of potential deductions. We would expect this effect to be most pronounced in lower income ranges where we could see a lot of switching from itemizers to standard-deduction takers. At the higher income levels, greater shares of taxpayers would remain itemizers, and the effect would be smaller.

We appear to see some of this in California between 2017 and 2018, but it is hard to be sure. Many things are going on when we look across years - changes in tax policies, behavioral choices by taxpayers to accelerate deductions into 2017 to take advantage of higher 2017 federal tax rates, and more.

Anyway, we don't pretend that we are making the best assumption, but we think it is pretty reasonable given the generally high correlations across years. It's an issue worth revisiting when time allows.
