# Create mapping of tax calculator vars to soi vars

We do this in its own qmd file to make it easy to find, because it is also used in the examine project.

## Setup 
```{r}
#| label: setup

source(here::here("R", "libraries.R"))
source(here::here("R", "constants.R"))

# 334283385.27000004 national pop

```

## Create and save the mapping

```{r}
#| label: create-save-variable-mapping

vmap <- read_csv(file="
varname, basevname, description
XTOT, XTOT, Population
c00100, MARS1, fstatus == 1
c00100, MARS2, fstatus == 2
c00100, MARS4, fstatus == 3
c00100, v00100, Adjusted gross income
e00200, v00200, Wages
e00300, v00300, Taxable interest income
e01700, v01700, Pensions and annuities included in AGI
e26270, v26270, Combined partnership and S corporation net income/loss
e18400, v18425, State and local income or sales taxes
e18500, v18500, State and local real estate taxes
", show_col_types = FALSE)

# note that e18400 is not reported for districts; we have allocated it to districts by S&L income taxes

write_csv(vmap, fs::path(CDINTERMEDIATE, "cd_variable_mapping.csv"))

```
